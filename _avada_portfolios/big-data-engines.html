<p>One of the greatest strengths of a general Big Data platform is that many applications can be loaded and executed, regardless of application type or data form. Our system is not an exception: machine learning, stream processing, and many more operations can benefit from services and features the system has to offer, including fine-grained data management and elastic job reconfiguration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning: </strong>Hot issues such as analyzing and predicting user interests, or personalized product recommendations and medical treatments all revolve around the field of machine learning. We attempt to embrace the vast pool of such demands by using our Big Data infrastructure. We propose an abstraction for applications, including machine learning algorithms and other general jobs, and also a runtime engine for operation execution. By capturing applications in our abstraction, our system computes an optimized run configuration in terms of job performance. Furthermore, the system dynamically applies the optimization during runtime instead of simply rerunning the job or notifying the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stream Processing: </strong>Distributed stream processing systems perform real-time Big Data processing by executing long-running continuous queries. Particularly in IoT environments, numerous users may send similar queries to the system performing similar computations. However, processing such repetitive queries can lead to redundant computations and inefficient resource usage. Also, this could degrade the system performance if not properly handled. Therefore to solve this problem, we are currently developing a stream processing system that supports efficient multi-query processing and automatic optimization of queries. Our system aims for runtime query optimization leading to better resource utilization in a stream processing cluster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unified Programming Layer: </strong>We perform research in building a unified programming layer for Big Data analytics. Many different data processing models and even a larger number of frameworks tailored for each model are present in the academia and the industry. Accordingly, developers and data scientists have to learn and use many different kinds of programming libraries and languages in order to build pipelined workflows composed of different frameworks. The unified programming layer will allow developers to use a single unified programming interface to perform multi-level data analysis across various data processing models. With its end-to-end workflow awareness, it will also be capable of optimizing user code in a way that maximizes job performance and minimizes resource usage of the cluster.</p>
